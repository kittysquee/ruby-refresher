# Ruby Refresher

This repository contains the code for my week 7 weekend challenge for [Maker's Academy](www.makersacademy.com). This involved revisiting Ruby as we will be delving into Ruby on Rails next week.

To run:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:kittysquee/ruby-refresher.git
```

To run the specs:
```
$ rspec questions_spec.rb
```
